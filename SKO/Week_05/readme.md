# It's Premiere Time

## Introduction
This week is mostly about looking at the digital interpretation of *House of Leaves* we have been working on for the past 4 weeks. I have indeed learnt so much from other people's work. And I am very pleased with the amount of efforts our team has been putten into, and the outcome is satisfied. I have to admit I did constantly worry about my VO but it turns out working well in the end. 

## Practice 

Work in Progress for this week

On the storyboard we updated on the script side by side on the scene accordingly so that everyone could see the same visual, this is a great experience of online collaboration. We created an updated script for everyone to comment on and have meetings to fix details until everyone is clear about what each scene is like. Here is a link for the updated script:

Regarding to the voice, I did up to 4 times to get it right, to me, my biggest reference on voice is from the film *Watchmem(2009)* and *Taxi Driver*

I used GarageBand for recording and I did insert music, sound effects and edited my own voice accordingly.

We have learnt more about working with text in p5.js. Made a few minal variations based on the codes Karen created
