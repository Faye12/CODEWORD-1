# It's Premiere Time

## Introduction
This week is mostly about looking at the digital interpretation of *House of Leaves* we have been working on for the past 4 weeks. I have indeed learnt so much from other people's work. And I am very pleased with the amount of efforts our team has been putten into, and the outcome is satisfied. I have to admit I did constantly worry about my VO but it turns out working well in the end.

## Practice 

[Script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19jYVR71h8XhRFNsr-k470x9JxL-L0lmXoieETXrT_1o/edit)

The way that we have always been working is that on the post production side, we are constantly updating the edit. We had a few edits going on and we share with the group so that group can make comments based on that, and we reshoot some of the shots. Some of the shots over a few times indeed. As Faye and I had sound design experience before. I recorded and worked on Garage Band for the sound and VO design for quite sometime.

On the storyboard we updated on the script side by side on the scene accordingly so that everyone could see the same visual, this is a great experience of online collaboration. We created an updated script for everyone to comment on and have meetings to fix details until everyone is clear about what each scene is like. Here is a link for the updated script:
