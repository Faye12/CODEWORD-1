# Film Making

## Introduction
This week is more about continue working on the film. 

## Practice 

Me and Faye are in charge of the storyboard, editing and sound design, more of pre-production and post-production. 



On the storyboard we updated on the script side by side on the scene accordingly so that everyone could see the same visual, this is a great experience of online collaboration. We created an updated script for everyone to comment on and have meetings to fix details until everyone is clear about what each scene is like. Here is a link for the updated script:
