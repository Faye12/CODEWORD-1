## Flow Chart

![pic](https://wwsiyang.github.io/CODEWORD/SKO/Week_09/flowchart.jpg)

I simplified my prototye and break down into flow chart of 4 stages: 

1. text fade - 2. combined/recombined - 3. infinite wording - 4. generative text 

***1. text fade***

I have done this code here for now 

***2. combine/recombine***

***3.Infinite***

***4.generative outcome: Electronic Literature***

for 2nd and 3rd stage I basically need it my sentence to be able to transform from one sentenc to another: 
"endlessly combined" to "recombined"

I haven't find the exact library that suits me, but the cloest I got is this one:

[textmorphing](https://editor.p5js.org/tom.smith/sketches/YEEdV1KCF)


and I do have my first part of the code done. Just a very simple fading, and I am a bit stucked on how to proceed from here. My understanding is that it is probably gonna be different classes invovle. But I am still not sure how could I morph/transit from one to another.
